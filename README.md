# GraphQL with Absinthe

Working my way through [Craft GraphQL APIs in Elixir with Absinthe](https://pragprog.com/book/wwgraphql/craft-graphql-apis-in-elixir-with-absinthe)

Each chapter has my notes and the final code after working through it.

* [Chapter 1 - Meet GraphQL](./ch01/README.md)
* [Chapter 2 - Building a Schema](./ch02/README.md)
* [Chapter 3 - Taking User Input](./ch03/README.md)
